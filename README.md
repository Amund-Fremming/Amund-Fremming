### 👋 Hey there!

I'm a backend-leaning software engineer with a strong foundation in C#, .NET, EF Core, and PostgreSQL. I also work comfortably with TypeScript and occasionally dip into React and React Native when the project calls for it.

Right now, I'm exploring **Rust** and **Golang** to deepen my knowledge. And currenly working as a consultant.

I'm driven by clean architecture, clear abstractions, tools that make teams move faster, and curiosity.

🛠️ **What I like working with:**
- C#, .NET, EF Core, PostgreSQL  
- TypeScript, React (and React Native when I’m feeling spicy)  
- Rust (currently learning)  
- Building projects from scratch—code that *actually runs*
