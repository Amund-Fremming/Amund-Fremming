### 👋 Hey there!

I'm a backend-leaning software engineer with a strong foundation in C#, .NET, EF Core, and PostgreSQL. I also work comfortably with TypeScript and occasionally dip into React and React Native when the project calls for it.

Right now, I'm exploring **Rust**—interested in its performance, safety, and how it challenges my way of thinking about systems.

I'm driven by clean architecture, clear abstractions, and tools that make teams move faster. Whether it’s designing APIs, writing database queries, or debugging edge cases, I enjoy being deep in the engine room of real-world systems.

🛠️ **What I like working with:**
- C#, .NET, EF Core, PostgreSQL  
- TypeScript, React (and React Native when I’m feeling spicy)  
- Rust (currently learning)  
- Building projects from scratch—code that *actually runs*
